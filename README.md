# SMFShop-Custom-Items
Two new items for SMFShop by Daniel15.
These items were originally created for a Harry Potter RPG forum [Büyücedünya RPG](https://web.archive.org/web/20230904154023/buyucedunya-rpg.com/index.php) for the potion brewing system and Chocolate Frog Card drops. These items are prototypes for more advanced items utilized in the game, which are worth meddling with as they are and can lead people to create much more complex items through logic lying underneath these two. Only the prototypes were provided, as they are working well and aren't highly specialized, so one can take them, understand them, and modify them based on their needs easier.

Item #1: Increase Karma and Roll a Custom Profile Field Stat Dice
This item allows you to use string-type Custom Profile Stat variables as some "stats" and roll dice using them as modifiers.

Item #2: Increase Karma and Create a New Item in Inventory
This item allows you to add an already existing type of item to the user's inventory upon use. This works well with the item above for actually adding the item crafted (if the roll was successful) and is also used as a "loot box" with a random number generator.
