# SMFShop-Custom-Items
Two new items for SMFShop of Daniel15.
These items are originally created for a Harry Potter RPG forum "https://buyucedunya-rpg.com/" for potion brewing system and Chocolate Frog Card drops.

Item #1: Increase Karma and Roll a Custom Profile Field Stat Dice
	This item allows you to use string type Custom Profile Stat variables as some "stats" and roll dice using them as modifiers.
	
Item #2: Increase Karma and Create New Item in Inventory
	This item allows you to add an already existing type of item into user's inventory on use. This works well with the item above for actually adding the item crafted, (if the roll was successful) also used as a "loot-box" with random number generator.
